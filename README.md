# Business-metrics-analysis Yandex.Afisha

Project description

I have been invited to an internship in the marketing analytics department of Yandex.Afisha. The first task: to help marketers reduce costs - abandon unprofitable sources of traffic and redistribute the budget.

There is Yandex.Afisha data from June 2017 to the end of May 2018:

A server log with data on Yandex.Afisha site visits,
unloading of all orders for this period,
statistics of advertising costs.

I will have to study:

how customers use the service,
when they make their first purchase on the site,

how much money each client brings the company,
when the cost of attracting a client pays off.

I need to analyse:

    2.1 Product metrics

  2.1.1 Calculate the DAU, WAU, and MAU. Calculate the average values of these metrics over the entire period. Display the changes in the metrics over time in graphs;
  
  2.1.2 Determine how many times a day users on average visit the website. Construct a graph showing the change in metrics over time;
  
  2.1.3 Investigate how much time users spend on the site. Find out the length of a typical user session over the entire period. To choose an appropriate average measure, plot a distribution graph. It is not necessary to study the change in duration of sessions over time;
  
  2.1.4 Calculate Retention Rate using cohort analysis. Show changes in the metric over time on the graph. Find the average Retention Rate for the second month of cohort "life".
  
    2.2 E-Commerce Metrics.

  2.2.1 Investigate how much time, on average, passes from the first visit to the site until a purchase is made. It is not necessary to study how this metric changes over time;
  
  2.2.2 Using cohort analysis or another method, calculate the average number of purchases per customer over a specific period, such as six months. It is not necessary to study the change of this metric over time;
  
  2.2.3 Calculate the average bill by grouping by time of purchase. Cohort analysis is not appropriate - it can distort the calculations. Construct a graph showing how the metric changes over time;
  
  2.2.4 Find out how LTV per customer changes by cohort. Remember that LTV is a cumulative metric. Calculate average LTV by cohort over 6 months; include cohorts that have "lived" at least 6 months. Service margin is 100%. Reflect metric changes in time on graph;
  
    2.3 Marketing metrics.

Calculate and graph how marketing metrics vary by advertising sources.
The same user may have come to the site from multiple sources, so it's important to identify the "main" source for each and factor that into the calculations. For example, the main source could be the first source of transition.

  2.3.1 Calculate the total marketing spend. Find out how spending is distributed across sources. Visualize how the metrics change over time;
  
  2.3.2 Calculate the average CAC per customer for the entire project and for each traffic source. Visualize changes in metrics on graphs;
  
  2.3.3 Calculate ROMI by cohort by source. Compare the ROMI for the same cohort life periods. Note that customers from different sources may have different LTVs. Construct graphs showing changes in metrics over time.
